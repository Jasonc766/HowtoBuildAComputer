                    <p>
                        If you’ve bought cooling fans, now is the time to install them where you need them. Try to keep your cooling setup balanced, so  air drawn in equals to being blown out. The plastic fan guards usually denotes where the air will come through. Typically you want two fans in the front drawing air in and at least one in the rear blowing air out. You could also add fans into the roof of the PC case for more exhaust, if your PC case has mounting points for them.    ​

                        <br><br>
                        ​(Intel): Slide the spring loaded retention arm out and up. Lift the bracket up leaving the plastic cover in place. Then, gently place your CPU inside the socket, matching the golden triangle located on the bottom left corner of the processor, with the triangle on the socket bracket.  Then, you should slide the securing bracket back into its original position so it locks in place underneath the screw, and secure the retention arm back down. During the process the protective plastic cover should pop off, so don't think you broke anything.
                        <br><br>
                        ​(AMD): Simply lift the retention arm in its raised position. You should then take your processor and match the golden triangle on the corner of the Ryzen processor with the triangle on the socket. Once the pins on the bottom of the processor lineup with the holes on the socket, drop it into place. Give it a little nudge to make sure it’s secure, then lower the retention arm back down and lock it into place.

                        ​​Installing the Ram to your Motherboard. First, push down the latches at either ends of the DDR4 slots on your motherboard. Then line up the notch on the bottom of the memory with the notch in the slot. After that, you can install the memory by carefully pushing down both sides of the memory into the slot. You should hear a clicking sound as the memory secures into place and the latches click back up.  Make sure you check on your motherboards manual to see which slot to put your RAM in, unless you are using all RAM slots.

                        ​(air) You’ll want to install the fans on to the cooler before installing it on the motherboard. Carefully orient the heatsink onto the pins of the mounting plate and secure in place with any provided thumb screws. Finally, plugging the 4-pin PWM fan header into the CPU Fan slot on the motherboard.

                        ​(liquid)  If your using a liquid cooler you will mostly likely want to install your motherboard in the case before installing the cooler as it will be easier. Follows basically the same process, but require more upfront work.  You'll probably have to attach fans onto the radiator and installing it into your PC case in advance. Depending on which liquid-cooler you’re using, you may also need to plug in a second four-pin cable into a dedicated AIO cooler header on your motherboard.

Then, find your motherboard’s rear I/O shield, and push it into the rectangular slot in the back of your PC case. Make sure it’s right side up by matching the pattern of cutouts to the arrangement of ports on the back of your motherboard. Next, lay your motherboard down inside the chassis on top of the standoffs installed in your chassis, carefully lining up its rear ports with the corresponding holes in the I/O shield. Then secure the motherboard down with the screws that came with the case .

                        ​​ This is when to plug in the rest of your system fans into any available slots on the board or, if your PC case has an integrated fan controller at the back of the chassis to route all your fans into, then directly onto the motherboard. It’ll also need to connect to the motherboard via USB header. Case connector tend to be located together on the motherboard near the front of the case. Make sure that you connect the USB ports, the Power and Reset switches, the LED power and hard drive lights, and the audio cable. Your motherboard’s manual will show you where on your motherboard these connectors attach to.

Also, the 3.5-inch drive caddies typically reserved for hard drives should have compatible mounting points too. No matter what type of storage drive you’re installing, ensure the connection ports are facing towards a cable cut-out inside your chassis as it will make routing cables easier.

                        ​If you’ve got a modular PSU, Find out the cables you need ahead of time, and plug them into your power supply first.  If your PC case comes with a PSU bracket, remove it ahead of time and attach it to the back of the unit. Next up thread the cables through the PSU slot in the back of the case first, and then slide the PSU into place, securing the bracket back onto the chassis.  Push it firmly against the inside wall as you attach it with four screws. For most cases facing the fan downwards or to the side away from the interior of your PC can draw in fresh air and exhaust heat through the back. ​

                        ​First take a look at your motherboard and locate the PCIe slot closest to your processor. Then, locate the two PCIe slots next to where you’ll want to install your GPU and remove them. It will involve undoing two screws on the PCIe slot covers and removing them. Take your graphics card out of the anti-static bag and line it up with the slots we just opened up. The rear I/O on the GPU should be facing out the back of the chassis. Once the gold contacts on your GPU make are touching the PCIe slot, gently push it into place until you hear a click. Then use the same screws we removed from the PCIe slot cover to secure the GPU into place. ​

                        ​​ Now you can plug in the rest of your power cables.  Identify your 8-pin EPS cable, and slide it up the back of the chassis, through the cable grommet and plug it into the 8 pin power slot at the top of the motherboard. Next, find the bulkier 24-pin cable plug it into the corresponding 24-pin ATX power port on the motherboard. Then, take your SATA power and connect it to any storage drives. This is also when to plug in the SATA Data cables between any storage drives and the motherboard as well.  Lastly, you’ll want to thread your PCIe power cable through the cutout in the PSU cover or any side holes, and plugging it into your GPU.

Download the Windows 10 Media Creation Kit and then install Windows 10 onto an USB stick with at least 8GB of space.  Then, once it’s finished, simply plug it into your new system. Go back into your BIOS to tell your system to boot from the USB stick first. From there you can go through the prompts to install the operating system onto your new PC. Don’t worry about not having a software key during installation, you can activate Windows 10 once you reach desktop.
