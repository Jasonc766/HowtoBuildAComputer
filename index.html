                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to build a PC is already hard enough for the first time. However, as long as you choose the right PC components, and you put everything in the right slot, you’ll do great. 
                    Lucky for you, this website can guide you through putting all of those expensive components together. Before long, you'll be the owner of a PC that was made by your own hands.
                    In this guide, we’re going to show you how to plan, ​Purchase and build a PC, step by step.

                <h2>​Planning - Step 1 Determine Your PC's Use</h2>
                <p>
                    Before you buy anything, you'll need to know what you plan on using
                    the computer for. Standard PCs which are used for things like browsing or small programs can use older,
                    less expensive parts, while gaming or editing focused computers will need more powerful parts.

                <h2>​Planning - ​Step 2 Set A Budget</h2>
                <p>
                    It's easy to start buying attractive parts and go overkill without sticking to a budget, only to realize that you're
                    out of money and don't have all of the necessary components to build your PC. Figure out a soft limit 
                    and a hard limit and stay within that range.
